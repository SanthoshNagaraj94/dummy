# Project Setup Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to set up the project using Docker or Python virtual environments on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Follow the steps relevant to your system and setup preference.

---

## 1. Docker Setup

Using Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for running the project. These steps will guide you through building and running the Docker container.

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Docker**:
   - **Linux**: Follow the [official Linux installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).
   - **macOS**: Follow the [official macOS installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
   - **Windows**: Follow the [official Windows installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

2. **Verify Installation**:
   After installing Docker, verify that it is correctly installed:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   The command should return the Docker version installed.

3. **Check Docker Service**:
   Ensure Docker is running:
   - **Linux**: Start Docker if it is not already running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start docker
     ```
   - **macOS/Windows**: Docker Desktop should automatically run upon startup. If not, open the Docker Desktop application.

### Steps to Set Up with Docker

#### 1.1 Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from your version control system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

#### 1.2 Create or Verify the Dockerfile
Ensure a `Dockerfile` is present in the project root. Below is an example of what the `Dockerfile` should look like:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the local project files to the container
COPY . /app

# Upgrade pip and install the project dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the required port
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "Train.py"]
```

#### 1.3 Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the `docker build` command:
```bash
docker build -t project-name .
```
- The `-t project-name` tag names your Docker image `project-name`.

#### 1.4 Run the Docker Container
Run the container from the built image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name project-container project-name
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 5000:5000`: Maps the container's internal port 5000 to the host's port 5000.
- `--name project-container`: Assigns a name to the running container for easier management.

#### 1.5 Verify the Running Container
- Check running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- View container logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs project-container
  ```
- Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` (replace `localhost` with the appropriate IP if Docker runs on a remote machine).

#### 1.6 Stopping and Removing the Container
- Stop the container:
  ```bash
  docker stop project-container
  ```
- Remove the container:
  ```bash
  docker rm project-container
  ```

## 2. Virtual Environment Setup

Setting up a Python virtual environment ensures dependency isolation and prevents conflicts with global Python packages. Below are detailed steps for each operating system.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
  - **Linux/macOS**: Check Python version:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
  - **Windows**: Check Python version:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    If Python is not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **`pip` Package Manager**: Ensure `pip` is installed and up-to-date:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

---

### 2.1 Linux and macOS Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Use Python’s built-in `venv` module to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   - This command creates a directory named `venv` in your project root.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the training script:
   ```bash
   python Train.py --start_date 2024-04-26 --end_date 2024-07-19 --config_file config/FeatureList.yaml
   ```

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   After you are done, deactivate the environment:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

---

### 2.2 Windows Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Use Python’s built-in `venv` module to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the training script:
   ```bash
   python Train.py --start_date 2024-04-26 --end_date 2024-07-19 --config_file config\FeatureList.yaml
   ```

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   After you are done, deactivate the environment:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## 3. Common Issues and Fixes

### 3.1 Docker Issues
- **Permission Denied on Linux**: Use `sudo` for Docker commands or add your user to the `docker` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```

- **Docker Daemon Not Running**: Start the Docker service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start docker
  ```

### 3.2 Virtual Environment Issues
- **`venv` Module Not Found**: Install `venv` using your system’s package manager:
  - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```
  - **macOS**: `venv` is included with Python 3.7+.
  - **Windows**: `venv` is included with Python 3.7+.

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Use a clean virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

## 4. Additional Tips

- **Environment Variables**:
  Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in a `.env` file and load them using `python-dotenv`:
  ```bash
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```

- **Customizing Ports**:
  To run multiple services, change the exposed port in the `Dockerfile` or `docker run` command.

- **Testing and Debugging**:
  Use logging for better insights. Adjust the logging level in `Train.py`:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  ```
